This project is to generate a wordlist of whole possible combination in an 8 to 12 spaced word.
I can't assure that this project is a success but it is basically finished.


In the last set of possible combos the whole characters of which i inputed for the generation of the cobos displays and i don't know why it happens.
And we may encounter a lagging problem if this project run through a gui application like through the terminal of visual studio codes, but works well if run through a terminal in linux distro.
Rather than that i don't find any other problem.
